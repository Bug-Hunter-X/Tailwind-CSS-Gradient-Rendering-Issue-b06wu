```javascript
<div class="bg-gradient-to-r from-blue-500 to-purple-500 p-4 rounded-lg shadow-md">
  <p>This is some text.</p>
</div>
```
This code uses Tailwind's gradient utility classes, but sometimes gradients might not render correctly, especially in older browsers or when there are conflicting CSS rules.  The issue could manifest as the gradient not showing at all, only showing one color, or showing unexpected banding.
